Automated Email Reminders with Machine Learning
===============================================

Our workflow
------------

1) Use the scraping script to harvest your gmail / google apps inbox and store the contents in a sqlite3 database.
    ```
    bundle exec ./scrape.rb me@domain.com mypassword
    ```

2) Compile (we use intellij) the java project located in ./EmailAnalysis.

3) Run CleaningMain (you may have to increase intellij/eclipse heap size) to preprocess the emails.

4) Run OracleCachingMain to compute and store the correct label for each email (whether it was responded to or not).

5) Run AnalysisMain. This runs all the analysis and prints the results to stdout (recall, precision, confusion matrices for each of various classification thresholds)

Where things are
----------------

### Our code

Ruby code used for scraping is in ./scrape.rb

Java code used for preprocessing and analysis is in ./EmailAnalysis/src/main/java/EmailAnalysis.

### Our data

Our data (the complete contents of people's email accounts) is pretty sensitive. We've extracted 5 safe sample emails (both the raw and clean versions). This should be enough to get the idea; check out SAMPLE_RAW_DATA.csv and SAMPLE_CLEAN_DATA.csv to see the data.

If having more sample data is very important to the grading process, please either run the scrape script and use your own emails, or contact [Leo](mailto:lmartel@stanford.edu) and [Andy](mailto:andymo@stanford.edu) and we can pull together a longer non-privacy-violating sample dataset :) 

### Libraries

- [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit)
    - Vowpal Wabbit is an open-source Stochastic Gradient Descent ML implementation.
    - Install and symlink to /usr/local/bin/vw
- [WiseRF](http://about.wise.io/wiserf/)
    - WiseRF is a Random Forest classifier
    - Free trial available [here](http://license.wise.io/)
    - Install and symlink to /usr/local/bin/wiserf
    - You'll also need to set WISERF_ROOT for API key verification. Just open WiseRFClassifier.java and change the string constant.
- [Rainbow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mccallum/bow/rainbow/)
    - Rainbow is an open source Naive Bayes implementation.
    - We built a classifier around Rainbow in an early version of the project but the final classifier does not use the RainbowClassifier.
    - Install and symlink to /usr/local/bin/rainbow
